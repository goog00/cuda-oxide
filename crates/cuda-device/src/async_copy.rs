//! Asynchronous copy intrinsics (`cp.async`).
//!
//! These intrinsics perform asynchronous copies from global memory to shared
//! memory using the `.ca` (cache-all-levels) cache policy.
//!
//! # Variants
//!
//! | Function          | Bytes | Cache | PTX                                              |
//! |-------------------|-------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
//! | [`cp_async_ca_4`] | 4     | `.ca` | `cp.async.ca.shared.global [smem], [gmem], 4;`   |
//! | [`cp_async_ca_8`] | 8     | `.ca` | `cp.async.ca.shared.global [smem], [gmem], 8;`   |
//!
//! # Notes
//!
//! The `.cg` (cache-global) cache policy is only supported for 16-byte copies,
//! so only `.ca` variants are provided for 4-byte and 8-byte copies.
//!
//! The functions are compiler-recognized stubs. Their bodies never execute; the
//! cuda-oxide compiler replaces each call with the corresponding PTX instruction.

/// Asynchronous 4-byte copy from global to shared memory with `.ca` cache policy.
///
/// Initiates an asynchronous copy of 4 bytes from global memory (`global_src`)
/// to shared memory (`shared_dst`) using the cache-all-levels (`.ca`) policy.
///
/// # PTX Instruction
///
/// `cp.async.ca.shared.global [shared_dst], [global_src], 4;`
///
/// # Safety
///
/// - `shared_dst` must point to 4 writable bytes in shared memory.
/// - `global_src` must point to 4 readable bytes in global memory.
/// - Both pointers must be aligned to 4 bytes.
/// - Both memory ranges must remain valid, and `global_src` must not be
///   modified, until the copy completes.
/// - `shared_dst` must not be read or written, including by an overlapping
///   asynchronous copy in the same group, until the copy completes.
/// - Before accessing the destination, the caller must complete this copy with
///   `cp.async.wait_all`, `cp.async.commit_group` followed by a matching
///   `cp.async.wait_group`, or an mbarrier that tracks this operation.
/// - Group waits cover copies issued by the executing thread. If another thread
///   will access the destination, synchronize the threads after completion.
/// - Completion instructions emitted with [`ptx_asm!`](crate::ptx_asm) must use
///   `clobber("memory")` so the compiler cannot move memory accesses across the
///   wait.
